# Shape_Detection
My app uses python, specifically contour detection, to determine the amount of sides in a given image and return the shape that has been submitted by a user. This application runs online because the user interface is built on Flask which uses HTML and CSS.

Rules and Regulations: To get the authorization token, open up the ngrok link when you run the code for the first time, create an account, and copy your token, and replace it with my token.
